\section{Data sets}

We collected three datasets from which we created the datasets used for pretraining and finetuning. 
Note that the datasets for pretraining and finetuning are mutually exclusive. 
We describe the three datasets in the following paragraphs.

\paragraph*{NCHLT dataset} Majority is used for pre-training, the rest is used for fine-tuning.

\paragraph*{FLEURS dataset} Used for fine-tuning

\paragraph*{High Quality TTS dataset} Used for fine-tuning

\paragraph*{Word error rate}
The word error rate (WER) is equal to the number of character-level errors in the predicted transcript, 
divided by the number of words in the true transcript. One character-level error is corrected using one of three operations:
inserting a new character, deleting an existing character, or substituting an existing character for a new character.
