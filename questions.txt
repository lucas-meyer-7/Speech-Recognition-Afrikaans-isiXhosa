Questions for Herman
-----------------------

   1. Are start/end of sentence symbols necessary?
   2. Should diacritics be removed?
   3. Is librosa the preferred library for dealing with WAV files?
   4. Model and learn the probability of each sentence.
      Use probabilities to create validation/test sets. (Overkill?)
   5. Basically, I'm not entirely sure what a sensible method is for 
      choosing a validation/test set.
